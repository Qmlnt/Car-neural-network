# Car-neural-network
A program to teach a simple car neural network to drive on a custom track.

This script is written in python using pygame, numpy and other modules.
Almost everything can be changed, the script is well commented and explained.
A custom track could be loaded and configured to teach the neural network to drive.
The neural is able to drive on an unfamiliar track if it's well trained.
Also don't blame me or the script if the car is stuck, it may take some time for it to \*learn* something, sometimes you'll need to restart the script, sometimes you may change the settings and get awesome results (just try to change turn_coef to 0.01 or lesser). :D
